# Line-Follower

## Used components:
  1. Arduino Uno
  
  2. Zip-ties
  
  3. Power source: a LiPo battery
  
  4. Wheels (2)
  
  5. Wires for the line sensor (female - male)
  
  6. QTR-8A reflectance sensor, along with screws
  
  7. Ball caster8.Extra wires from the kit or lab
  
  9. Chassis
  
  10. Breadboard - medium (400pts)
  
  11. L293D motor driver
  
  12. DC motors (2)
  
## Code:
  1. Automated calibration:
      * How to do: Calculated the errors given by the sensors and changed the movement left or right according to it, raising the speed for every move from 180 to 250
  2. PID implementation:
      * How to do: Implemented the PID according to the car movement, no if conditions used, just the main formula to set the car after several tries
  3. Motor setting function:
      * How to do: Set the motor speed for each motor according to the errors calculated from the values given by the sensor

### Time from the race: 19.67
